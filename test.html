        The word Islam means 'submission to God' or to submit your will to the almighty God. The religion was started by Muhammad in the 7th century when Muhammad was believed 
        to have received divine revalation from Allah(God in arabic), the Qur'an. Since one of the meanings of Islam is 'submission to God', Muslims believe that Islam started from 
    the very first two humans on earth Adam and Eve because they submitted their will to God. Islam is a Abrahamic religion that believes strictly 
    in one God and that you should never associate any partners to God almigty. <div class = "underLine" > </div>

The Kaaba in Mecca is the direction of prayer and destination of pilgrimage
In Arabic, Islam (Arabic:إسلام, "submission [to God]") is the verbal noun originating from the verb سلم (salama), from triliteral root س-ل-م (S-L-M), which forms a large class of words mostly relating to concepts of wholeness, submission, sincerity, safeness, and peace.[37] Islam is the verbal noun of Form IV of the root and means "submission" or "total surrender". In a religious context, it means "total surrender to the will of God".[1][38] A Muslim (Arabic:مُسْلِم), the word for a follower of Islam, is the active participle of the same verb form, and means "submitter (to God)" or "one who surrenders (to God)". The word "Islam" ("submission") sometimes has distinct connotations in its various occurrences in the Quran. Some verses stress the quality of Islam as an internal spiritual state: "Whoever God wills to guide, He opens their heart to Islam."[i][38] Other verses connect Islam and religion (dīn) together:[ii]

"Today, I have perfected your religion for you; I have completed My blessing upon you; I have approved Islam for your religion."[39]

Others describe Islam as an action of returning to God—more than just a verbal affirmation of faith.[iii] In the Hadith of Gabriel, Islam is presented as one part of a triad that also includes imān (faith), and ihsān (excellence).[40][41]

The word "silm" (Arabic:سِلْم) in Arabic means both peace and also the religion of Islam.[42] A common linguistic phrase demonstrating its usage is "he entered into as-silm" (Arabic:دَخَلَ فِي السِّلْمِ) which means "he entered into Islam," with a connotation of finding peace by submitting one's will to the Will of God.[42] The word "Islam" can be used in a linguistic sense of submission or in a technical sense of the religion of Islam, which also is called as-silm which means peace.[42]

Islam itself was historically called Mohammedanism in the English-speaking world. This term has fallen out of use and is sometimes said to be offensive,
 as it suggests that a human being, 
 rather than God, is central to Muslims' religion, parallel to Buddha in Buddhism.[43] 
 Some  authors,however, continue to use the term Mohammedanism as a technical term for the religious system as opposed to the theological concept of Islam that 
 exists within that system.

    The central concept of Islam is tawḥīd (Arabic:توحيد), the unity of God. Usually thought of as a precise monotheism, but also panentheistic in Islamic mystical teachings.[43]
     God is described in Chapter 112 of the Quran: Say, “He is God—One and Indivisible; God—the Sustainer ˹needed by all˺.
      He has never had offspring, nor was He born. And there is none comparable to Him.” No human eyes can see God till the Day Of Judgement.
       According to Islam, God is transcendent, therefore Muslims do not attribute human forms to God. God is described and referred to by several names or attributes,
        the most common being Ar-Rahmān(الرحمان) meaning "The Entirely Merciful,"
         and Ar-Rahīm( الرحيم) meaning "The Especially Merciful" which are mentioned before reciting every chapter of the Quran except chapter nine.[45][46]

    Islam teaches that the creation of everything in the universe was brought into being by God's command as expressed by the wording, 
    "Be, and it is," and that the purpose of existence is to worship God without associating partners to Him.[v][48][49] God is not a part of the Christian Trinity.
    [50] He is viewed as a personal god who responds whenever a person in need or distress calls him.[vi][47] There are no intermediaries, such as clergy, to contact God, 
    who states: "Your Lord has proclaimed, Call upon Me, I will respond to you."[vii] Consciousness and awareness of God is referred to as Taqwa.
     Allāh is traditionally seen as the personal name of God,[51] a term with no plural or gender being ascribed to it.
      It is used by Muslims and Arabic-speaking Christians and Jews in reference to God, whereas ʾilāh 
      (Arabic: إله‎) is a term used for a deity or a god in general. <div class = "underLine">  </div>

      The universe
In order to prove the unity of God, the Qurʾān lays frequent stress on the design and order in the universe. 
There are no gaps or dislocations in nature. Order is explained by the fact that every created thing is endowed with a definite and defined nature whereby it falls into a pattern. 
This nature, though it allows every created thing to function in a whole, sets limits,
 and this idea of the limitedness of everything is one of the most fixed points in both the cosmology and theology of the Qurʾān. 
 The universe is viewed, therefore, as autonomous, in the sense that everything has its own inherent laws of behaviour, but not as autocratic, 
 because the patterns of behaviour have been endowed by God and are strictly limited. “Everything has been created by us according to a measure.”
  Though every creature is thus limited and “measured out” and hence depends upon God, God alone, who reigns unchallenged in the
  heavens and the earth, is unlimited, independent, and self-sufficient. <div class = "underLine">

Humanity
According to the Qurʾān, God created two apparently parallel species of creatures, human beings and jinn, the one from clay and the other from fire. About the jinn, however, the Qurʾān says little, although it is implied that the jinn are endowed with reason and responsibility but are more prone to evil than human beings are. It is with humanity that the Qurʾān, which describes itself as a guide for the human race, is centrally concerned. The story of the Fall of Adam (the first man) promoted in Judaism and Christianity is accepted, but the Qurʾān states that God forgave Adam his act of disobedience, which is not viewed in the Qurʾān as original sin in the Christian sense of the term.

In the story of the creation of humanity, Iblīs, or Satan, who protested to God against the creation of human beings, because they “would sow mischief on earth,” lost in the competition of knowledge against Adam. The Qurʾān, therefore, declares humanity to be the noblest of all creation, the created being who bore the trust (of responsibility) that the rest of creation refused to accept. The Qurʾān thus reiterates that all nature has been made subservient to humans, who are seen as God’s vice-regent on earth; nothing in all creation has been made without a purpose, and humanity itself has not been created “in sport” but rather has been created with the purpose of serving and obeying God’s will.

Despite this lofty station, however, the Qurʾān describes human nature as frail and faltering. 
Whereas everything in the universe has a limited nature and every creature recognizes its limitation and insufficiency,
 human beings are viewed as having been given freedom and therefore are prone to rebelliousness and pride,
  with the tendency to arrogate to themselves the attributes of self-sufficiency. Pride, thus, is viewed as the cardinal sin of human beings,
   because, by not recognizing in themselves their essential creaturely limitations, they become guilty of ascribing to themselves partnership with God
    (shirk: associating a creature with the Creator) and of violating the unity of God. 
    True faith (īmān), thus, consists of belief in the immaculate Divine Unity and islām (surrender) in one’s  submission to the Divine Will.<div class = "underLine"> </div>

<h3 class = "tawhid">
Satan, sin, and repentance
In order to communicate the truth of Divine Unity, God has sent messengers or prophets to human beings, whose weakness of nature makes them ever prone to forget or even willfully to reject Divine Unity under the promptings of Satan. According to the Qurʾānic teaching, the being who became Satan (Shayṭān or Iblīs) had previously occupied a high station but fell from divine grace by his act of disobedience in refusing to honour Adam when he was ordered to do so. Since then his work has been to beguile human beings into error and sin. Satan is, therefore, the contemporary of humanity, and Satan’s own act of disobedience is construed by the Qurʾān as the sin of pride. Satan’s machinations will cease only on the Last Day.

Judging from the accounts of the Qurʾān, the record of humanity’s acceptance of the prophets’ messages has been far from perfect. 
The whole universe is replete with signs of God. The human soul itself is viewed as a witness of the unity and grace of God. The messengers of God have,
 throughout history, been calling humanity back to God.
  Yet not all people have accepted the truth; many of them have rejected it and become disbelievers (kāfir, plural kuffār; literally,
   “concealing”—i.e., the blessings of God), and, when a person becomes so obdurate,
    his heart is sealed by God. Nevertheless, it is always possible for a sinner to repent (tawbah) and redeem himself by a genuine conversion to the truth. 
    There is no point of no return, and God is forever merciful and always willing and ready to pardon.
     Genuine repentance has the effect of removing all sins and restoring a person to the state of sinlessness with which he started his life.  <div class = "underLine"></div>

Prophecy
Prophets are men specially elected by God to be his messengers. Prophethood is indivisible, and the Qurʾān requires recognition of all prophets as such without discrimination. Yet they are not all equal, some of them being particularly outstanding in qualities of steadfastness and patience under trial. Abraham, Noah, Moses, and Jesus were such great prophets. As vindication of the truth of their mission, God often vests them with miracles: Abraham was saved from fire, Noah from the Deluge, and Moses from the pharaoh. Not only was Jesus born from the Virgin Mary, but God also saved him from crucifixion at the hands of the Jews. The conviction that God’s messengers are ultimately vindicated and saved is an integral part of the Qurʾānic doctrine.

All prophets are human and never part of divinity: they are the most perfect of humans who are recipients of revelation from God. When God wishes to speak to a human, he sends an angel messenger to him or makes him hear a voice or inspires him. Muhammad is accepted as the last prophet in this series and its greatest member, for in him all the messages of earlier prophets were consummated. The archangel Gabriel brought the Qurʾān down to the Prophet’s “heart.” Gabriel is represented by the Qurʾān as a spirit whom the Prophet could sometimes see and hear. According to early traditions, the Prophet’s revelations occurred in a state of trance when his normal consciousness was transformed. This state was accompanied by heavy sweating. The Qurʾān itself makes it clear that the revelations brought with them a sense of extraordinary weight: “If we were to send this Qurʾān down on a mountain, you would see it split asunder out of fear of God.”

This phenomenon at the same time was accompanied by an unshakable conviction that the message was from God,
 and the Qurʾān describes itself as the transcript of a heavenly “Mother Book” written on a “Preserved Tablet.” 
 The conviction was of such an intensity that the Qurʾān categorically 
 denies that it is from any earthly source,   for in that case it would be liable to “manifold doubts and oscillations.”
